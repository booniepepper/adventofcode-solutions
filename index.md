# Advent of Code 2020

I'm doing Advent of Code this year. https://adventofcode.com/2020

My personal challenge is:
* Use a different language for each day
* Read the input from a file
* Print results to stdout

In some languages IO is new to me.

# Spoilers ahead!

I'm not caring too much about reformatting, "production
quality," or finding the absolute best performing algorithm in
these, so take all code, especially its quality, with a grain of
salt.
