# Advent of Code solutions

I started solving [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) starting in 2020.

My personal challenge is:

* Use a different language for each day
* Read the input from a file
* Print results to stdout

# Spoilers included!

I'm not caring too much about reformatting, "production
quality," or finding the absolute best performing algorithm in
these, so take all code, especially its quality, with a grain of
salt.

[This site](https://hiljusti.github.io/adventofcode-solutions) is hosted using github pages + jekyll.
