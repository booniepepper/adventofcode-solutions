# Advent of Code 2020

I'm doing Advent of Code this year. https://adventofcode.com/2020

My personal challenge is:
* Use a different language for each day
* Read the input from a file
* Print results to stdout

Mostly because in some languages, IO is something I haven't done before.

Spoilers ahead!
