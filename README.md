# Advent of Code solutions

I started solving  starting in 2020.

My personal challenge is:

* Use a different programming language for each day
* Read the input from a file
* Print results to stdout

# Spoilers included!

I'm not caring _too_ much about reformatting, "production quality," or finding the absolute best performing algorithm in these. Take all code, especially its quality, with a grain of salt.
